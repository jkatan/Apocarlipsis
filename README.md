# Apocarlipsis
Competitive 1v1 action game. Each player can play as a human (Carlitos) or as an Alien. Both players fight for their lives on a wrecked spaceship, running, dodging bullets from every angle, shooting and activating special shields. The objective is to defeat your enemy, the best of three rounds wins.

The tricky mechanics that make this game more interesting are the following:
* Bullets bounce against the walls a certain amount of times before disappearing, so dodging a bullet once does not guarantee that it will not hit you later.
* You cannot control when you want to shoot. Your gun is constantly shooting bullets, so you will not only have to be careful with your oponent, but also with yourself.
* You can activate a special shield that will protect you from incoming bullets making them bounce in the opposite direction. This shield only lasts one second, so use it wisely. To use it again you will have to wait 3 seconds.

To play the game two Xbox 360 controllers are needed. Each player can move with the left stick and aim with the right stick, and use the shield with the LB button.
